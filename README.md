# SpecGenzo
This project provides a comprehensive and structured summary of useful rules and special nuances across HTML, SVG, and MathML specifications, using the Go programming language. The summarized specifications are made available in a TOML format, making them easy to integrate with templating languages and other code generation tools.

## Purpose

1. **Enhanced Code Generation**: By offering an easy-to-consume specification, this project aids in the generation of accurate and optimized code, leading to better development practices.
2. **Developer Education**: This repository serves as an educational resource, keeping developers informed about modern web specifications and best practices that they might otherwise miss.
3. **Unified Specification Reference**: It brings together various namespaces (HTML, SVG, MathML) into a single cohesive structure, simplifying the understanding and implementation of web standards.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Tag and Attribute Configuration**: Provides detailed configuration for tags and attributes, including self-closing tags, supported child elements, and documentation URLs.
- **Attributes Categorization**: Attributes are categorized and mapped for easy reference, allowing templating engines to support attribute categories effortlessly.
- **Developer-Friendly Documentation**: Each configuration entry is thoroughly documented, ensuring that developers understand the purpose and usage of each tag and attribute.

## Usage

- **Templating Engines**: Templating languages can use this specification to generate web templates that are compliant with modern web standards.
- **Code Generators**: Use the summarized specifications to create code generators that produce better, standards-compliant web code.
- **Educational Tools**: Enhance tools and platforms focused on educating developers about the latest web standards and best practices.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-specification-summarizer.git
```
2. **Load Configuration**: Use the Go code provided to load the TOML file and integrate it into your project.
3. **Generate Code**: Utilize the parsed configurations to generate compliant and optimized code for your web projects.

### Roadmap of Features

To help visualize the development and implementation timeline of this project, we've broken down key features into phased milestones. Each milestone focuses on adding specific functionalities and enhancing the repository incrementally.

---

**Phase 1: Basic Configuration and Tag Support**
- **HTML, SVG, MathML Tags**: 
  - Enumerate all standard tags for HTML, SVG, and MathML.
  - Define whether each tag is self-closing.
  - Document special attributes for each tag.
  
**Deliverable**: Initial TOML file containing basic tag configurations with self-closing tags identified and special attributes listed.

---

**Phase 2: Attribute Enhancements**
- **Initial Values for Attributes**:
  - Define and include initial/default values for attributes.
  - Enhance the reliability and usability of the specification.
  
**Deliverable**: Updated TOML file that includes initial values for specified attributes, improving accuracy.

---

**Phase 3: Child Tag Support**
- **Supported Child Tags**:
  - Identify and document which tags are valid children for each tag.
  - Ensure that templates and code generators can respect parent-child tag relationships.
  
**Deliverable**: Comprehensive list of supported child tags for each parent tag, enhancing template performance and validation.

---

**Phase 4: Detailed Documentation and Comments**
- **Comments and Descriptions**:
  - Add detailed and informative comments for each tag and attribute.
  - Integrate descriptions that can be used by Language Server Protocols (LSP) to enhance editor tooltips and inline help.
  
**Deliverable**: Well-documented TOML file with rich descriptions and comments, supporting enhanced development environments.

---

**Phase 5: Automated Standard Updates**
- **Automated Processes**:
  - Develop scripts to automatically scan for updates in web standards.
  - Implement automation to detect deprecated attributes, experimental attributes, and browser compatibility.
  - Regularly update the specification based on the latest standards.
  
**Deliverable**: A robust automation pipeline that keeps the specification up-to-date with minimal manual intervention, ensuring ongoing accuracy and relevance.

---

### Additional Goals

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Set up CI workflows to ensure the integrity of the TOML files and consistency of the generated specs.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Formulate clear guidelines for contributors to ensure coherent and consistent updates to the repository.
- **Community Engagement**: Encourage open discussions, gather feedback, and collaborate with developers to enhance the specification progressively.
